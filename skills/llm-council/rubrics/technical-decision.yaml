evaluation_notes: |
  For technical decisions:
  - Evaluate quality of trade-off analysis
  - Check if context constraints are considered
  - Value concrete, implementable recommendations
  - Consider long-term implications
  - Penalize one-sided advocacy without alternatives

examples:
  suitable:
    - "Should we use microservices or monolith?"
    - "Which database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB?"
    - "Is this API design reasonable?"
    - "What's the best caching strategy?"

  unsuitable:
    - "What is REST?" # Factual question
    - "Explain recursion" # Educational question
